This project is about finding of the air quality predictions by using of the machine learning models and the deep learning methods. In the current situation the predictions of the Air Quality Index is important for the sustainability approaches across the activities of the populations. Air quality modelling has experienced a paradigm shift in recent decades, where older statistical and empirical methods have been replaced with new advanced, databased modelling methods driven by machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). Here, the analysis would be by the implications of the Logistic Regressions, Random Forest and XGBoost. Temperature (o C), Humidity (in %), PM2.5 and PM10 levels (fine and coarse particulate matter respectively), and gaseous pollutants like NO 2, SO 2, and CO are being used for the analysis of the air quality. Thus, from the results it is observed that the overlapping results of PM2.5 and PM10 are the important to reduce the “Hazardous” within the air quality. However, with the further recommendations on AI-based algorithms, a combination of numerical simulation models for increasing the rate of prediction and pollutants dispersion modelling, hybrid models strengthening a data-driven approach to reduce the chance of complexity in the air quality estimation in the industrial areas, and to expand smart city implementation plans.
